# Some Ciphers
Just playing with ciphers in Python.  
There are currently two ciphers presented:
* The Caesar cipher (mono alphabet subsitution cipher)
* An Extended Vinegere cipher (poly alphabet substition cipher)

Both ciphers are implemented as a Python class.  
* See the caesar_class.py and vinegere_class.py files.
