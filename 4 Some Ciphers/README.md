# Some Ciphers
Just playing with ciphers in Python.  
There are currently two ciphers presented:
* The [Caesar cipher](https://github.com/drmagu/Vignettes-of-Python/blob/master/4%20Some%20Ciphers/caesar.md#caesar-cipher) (mono alphabet subsitution cipher)
* An [Extended Vinegere cipher](https://github.com/drmagu/Vignettes-of-Python/blob/master/4%20Some%20Ciphers/vigenere.md#vigenere) (poly alphabet substition cipher)

Both ciphers are implemented as a Python class.  
* See the caesar_class.py and vinegere_class.py files.
