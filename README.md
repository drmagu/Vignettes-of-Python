# Vignettes of Python
The purpose of this repo is to present various Python related things.  

## What is a 'vignette'
We will use this definition as based on what I found in Wikipedia:  
"short, evocative account that gives a particular insight into a character, idea, or setting"  

## How did I decide what to write about
This is obviously personal. Mostly these are ideas, or pythonic concepts that for some reason piqued my interest.  

## Enjoy!
